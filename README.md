# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-IBM
The Applied Data Science capstone is part of the 12 course series IBM Data Science professional certificate provided by IBM.

# Project Background
SpaceX is widely regarded as the most successful company of the commercial space age, significantly reducing the cost for space travel. The company advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 
62 million dollars while other providers charge upto 165 million dollars per launch. Much of this cost reduction comes from SpaceX's ability to to reuse the rocket's first stage.Consequently, predicting whether
the first stage will successfully land allows us to estimate the cost of a launch. Using publicly available data and machine learning models, this project aims to forecast the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage.

# Questions to be answered
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights , and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing?
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years?
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification in this case?

# Methodology

## 1. Data collection methodology
  - Using SpaceX rest API
  - Using web scrapping from wikipedia

##  2. Perform Data Wrangling
  - Filtering Data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using one hot encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification

## 3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualization and SQL

## 4. Perform interactive visual analytics using folium and Plotly Dash

## 5. Perform predictive analysis using classification models
   - Building, tuning and evaluation of classification models to ensure best results.
